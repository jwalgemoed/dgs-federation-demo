If you are looking for something family-friendly or 'nice', then you wouldn't even consider watching this in the first place. While I don't think I'd put myself in either group, I am not really a bit fan of gore and although I can respect the film, it really isn't a film for me. So why did I watch it? Well, with well over 17000 reviews and an overall IMDb score that places it near the top of all films, then it's natural I'd get to it sooner or later.As for the film, I won't say much--there are already TONS of reviews for this one. Suffice to say that the plot is exceptional--complex, shocking and worth seeing. The acting also is quite nice all around. The bottom line is that this IS a quality production and if it's the sort of thing you'd normally watch, watch away and enjoy."},{"username":"TheLittleSongbird","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2251710","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"18 May 2010","rate":"10","helpful":"27 out of 33 found this helpful.","title":"A brilliant postmodern film noir that is grim, intelligent and disturbing","content":"From David Fincher, Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox"},{"username":"Leofwine_draca","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0482513","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2580485","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"13 March 2012","rate":"8","helpful":"12 out of 18 found this helpful.","title":"It doesn't get much more influential than this...","content":"Two very different films about serial killers ruled Hollywood in the 1990s: 1991's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, featuring Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter, and this, David Fincher's masterpiece about a pair of New York cops tackling a perverted killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. SE7EN is an extremely stylish film that ended up inspiring dozens of copycats like RESURRECTION and THE BONE COLLECTOR: all of the films share a gritty-grimy style with depictions of unflinching violence, seedy backdrops and sleazy characters.Whichever way you look at it, SE7EN is a great movie. It has a pair of sterling performances from relative newcomers Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, playing stock clichéd characters: the young rookie and the older, wiser cop on the verge of retirement. Both Pitt and Freeman overcome their characters' conventions to make them believable people. Their quarry is Kevin Spacey, giving one of his traditionally disturbed portrayals as a sociopath with no inklings of good or evil. Much of the film is made up of police procedural elements, with the investigation of crime scenes, the following of leads and at least one fantastic chase sequence halfway through in which Fincher's direction is top notch. It's also blessed with a gruesomely dark twist ending which stays in your head forever afterwards.For what it's worth, I'd pick SE7EN over SILENCE every time."},{"username":"Michael_Elliott","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1910866","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"14 July 2008","rate":"","helpful":"5 out of 12 found this helpful.","title":"Great","content":"Seven (1995) **** (out of 4)Intense and rather disturbing thriller has Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman playing detectives trying to track down a serial killer who is using the seven deadly sins as his motive. I remember seeing this the opening day in theaters and I really left the theater disappointed. While I found it a good entertainment, it never really struck me as anything great until many years later on repeat viewings. Today I think the story, acting and directing makes it one of the best films of the decade. Fincher's dark style really creates a thick and rather eerie atmosphere, which runs from the opening to closing credits. The screenplay offers up a lot of tense action but I think the key to the film is the quieter moments where we get to know the two detectives as well as Pitt's wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow. When the killer's identity is finally revealed, and I won't ruin it here, the film even lets us get to know him in perhaps the most chilling scene in the movie. I think having the violence centered around the seven deadly sins was an interesting choice and the motives and conclusion could be endlessly debated. I guess it's to be expected that Freeman and Pitt would be opposite type of characters and the screenplay doesn't take the easy way out on this but instead it uses this to bring up the energy and we're able to see the killer from two different view points, which is a rare thing in thrillers like this. Both men give excellent performances with Freeman being the older, wiser man while Pitt is still wet behind the year but trying to make his mark in the profession. I know this film was a hit when originally released but it seems like it's become a classic over the past few years and I personally wouldn't argue with anyone calling this film that. I think it gets better with each viewing in the same sense that many Hitchcock thrillers get better."},{"username":"SnoopyStyle","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3239081","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"15 May 2015","rate":"9","helpful":"7 out of 10 found this helpful.","title":"beautiful darkness","content":"Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is a wearied homicide detective.

It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it.

I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous.

Spacey won the very same year though and it was an amazing 1995 for him. Fittingly, these over 2 hours here are at their best in the last half hour when he visibly enters the picture. I am fairly certain that the greatness of these last 30 minutes clouds many people's judgments about this movie. Lets be honest. The first 1.5 hours are really solid, but not great. The idea of letting a killer commit his murder in style of the seven deadly sins is a nice one, but the execution in detail left me wanting for more of course. I am not the greatest Pitt or Paltrow fan, but they play their characters well here. And Morgan Freeman is a delight as always for sure.I personally believe that if they had managed to keep the first three quarters of the film more essential and possibly kept the movie 15-20 minutes shorter, this may have been an even more rewarding watch. The director is David Fincher by the way and after a prolific career of music video direction (and Aliens 3), this film here was his big breakthrough that turned him into one of the A-list directors in Hollywood, which he still is today. Nonetheless, I have to be a bit critical about this film here. IMDb has it almost in the top20 films of all time based on the rating and that is very exaggerated. The critics consensus seems more appropriate. It is probably among the 10 best films of 1995, but nowhere near being an all-time great film. As much as I liked the final chapter here, I would need to be very generous already to call it an all-time great ending. Still, the film is worth seeing at least once for sure and I recommend it, especially if you like the actors."},{"username":"bob the moo","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370671","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"29 March 2002","rate":"","helpful":"40 out of 53 found this helpful.","title":"Simply one of the darkest and best thrillers of the 1990's \u0096 but don't let anyone spoil it for you.....","content":"`Days from retirement' Detective Somerset is teamed with new-to-the-city Detective Mills to investigate a murder that quickly becomes a series. Somerset realises that the killer must be smart and is using classic literature to model his killings on the seven deadly sins, however Mills finds to hard to see him as anything other than a crazy man. With the killer close to completing his work, Mills and Somerset begin to close in on him. However nothing is as it seems in a dark depressing city full of moral degradation and apathy.When David Fincher came onto the scene with his debut feature Alien3 the world only paused to scorn a film that didn't fit in with the Alien franchise. Yes it wasn't a great film \u0096 but I loved the sense of mood, the dark the tension in the shadows that Fincher created. Years later we have Se7en, Fight Club, The Game, and at people are getting Fincher!Se7en was his major break through \u0096 where his dark visions also reaped box-office gold. The story doesn't sound like much \u0096 mismatched partners (one young, cocky and reckless \u0096 the other a few days from retirement) go after a serial killer who is carrying out a series of twisted murders ..it sounds like Lethal Weapon meets a straight to video thriller. But happily it rises above that by so much it's unbelievable .it certainly shows how a story put in good hands can work out. From the start we are entombed in mood \u0096 the city where it always rains, the uncaring people etc. The we begin to find murders \u0096 but Fincher doesn't show us the murders, he lets us see the aftermath in the shadows and lets us imagine the rest \u0096 Genius!What you don't see is more gory than what you do. Meanwhile the tension is cranked up to fever pitch as the race to catch the killer is accelerated. When we meet the killer, the film just gets better right up to an ending that is simply one of the most logical, emotional and gripping endings I've ever seen. I promise you'll leave the cinema shell shocked.Freeman is excellent as Somerset \u0096 so good that it's a role he's tried to do again in `Kiss the girls' etc. But here he is the perfect foil for both Mills and the killer. Brad Pitt is also superb....he isn't allowed to trade on his looks here and does very well in a film that has little opportunity for him to pander to his female fans \u0096 he spends a lot of it looking beaten up. Paltrow is OK with what she has \u0096 but this isn't really a film that focuses on female roles. R. Lee Ermey is as good as ever and it's a sign of how good the cast is that actors of the stature of Charles Dutton and John C McGinley are basically in roles that barely count as cameos.However the best performance is from Kevin Spacey in the years before he became an Oscar lovie and stopped doing bad guys or dark characters. He is only on screen for a small portion of the film but his dialogue is superb and he delivers it faultlessly. In the scene where he shares a car ride with Mills and Somerset you literally hang on his every word. However alongside Spacey Fincher stands triumphant with his dark vision given the perfect story and perfect actors.At heart this is a cop thriller \u0096 but excellent performances, excellent mood and a moral lesson from an excellent Spacey make this quite simply the most jaw-droppingly excellent thriller of the 1990's."},{"username":"nogodnomasters","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77881167","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4498463","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"7 December 2018","rate":"10","helpful":"2 out of 7 found this helpful.","title":"I'M NOT SPECIAL","content":"I have seen this film mentioned multiple times in other movies, I decided I needed to view this film so I can catch innuendos in others.Morgan Freeman is a retiring city detective.

WRATH\".","content":"The formula has been used before, an experienced and world weary detective (Morgan Freeman) is assigned a veritable rookie (Brad Pitt) as a partner to solve a crime that's about to evolve into a serial murder case. That's pretty much where the similarities end however, as director David Fincher takes us on a compelling, if not sordid ride into the belly of a cinematic beast. Based on the theme of the seven deadly sins, \"Se7en\" is a film you're not likely to forget, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. Though the sin of gluttony opens the story with the gruesome imagery provided by a coroner's description of the crime, the horror only builds as detectives Somerset (Freeman) and Mills (Pitt) follow the taunting trail of a yet to be identified killer. As the story progresses, the method of the murderer involves some of the most disgusting ways to dispatch a victim, and it's the discomfort the viewer has in imagining these crimes that play such a visceral part of the film's experience.For all of the picture's implied gore and violence, the most riveting sequence of the film takes place after John Doe gives himself up, leaving the viewer to wonder how this is all going to play out. I must say, Kevin Spacey can be a harrowing presence in a film, and the way he portrays the serial killer is a study in implied menace. His demonic influence overpowers the ride out to the field where he's about to unload both barrels on the pair of detectives. His envy of the lawmen's skill compels the final deadly sin of wrath to bring the picture to a gut wrenching conclusion.This film is not for the faint of heart, and definitely not for someone who likes their crime thrillers wrapped up neatly with a bow by the time it's over. Somerset certainly knew that \"This isn't going to have a happy ending\", but little could he have expected the twisted result of John Doe's final act of desperate, solemn fury."},{"username":"lee_eisenberg","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4888011","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1121606","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"8 July 2005","rate":"10","helpful":"5 out of 9 found this helpful.","title":"7 is not the lucky number for some people","content":"You have probably never seen a particularly ugly murder until you see \"Se7en\".

For the last seven days of the retiring detective's career, they must track down a serial killer who bases his killings around the seven deadly sins. Gwenyth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, John C. McGinley, and Richard Roundtree also appear.This film starts out with an amazing Nine Inch Nails remix of \"Closer\" over some spooky credits that will play a part in the film later on (but you probably will not make the connection until your second viewing). This sets the tone for a mid-1990s film of nihilistic, dark despair. Unlike another mid-1990s film (\"Empire Records\") that focused on the pop aspects, this film is for all those who saw the dark side of the decade.That nihilism is evident, and really summed up the 1990s for some (and ushered in the peak of Tim Burton's career, along with industrial music and films like \"The Doom Generation\". John Doe speaks of the general \"apathy\" of the world, which came to the forefront in the 1990s, I think, with Marilyn Manson and ultimately ending with Columbine when we were shocked back to our senses. If the 1990s were a color, it would have been black.Visually, the film is stunning, even in the death shots. The gluttony victim, which starts the movie out, is a corpse you will never forget. The acting here is quite good, perhaps among Brad Pitt's best work. There is an odd moment or two, but overall he is flawless. This is likely the film that solidified his career for the next decade (more than \"Thelma and Louise\" ever did). Morgan Freeman is great, but when is he not? His mere presence exudes genius.As far as serial killer dramas go, this one is as well written as possible. Another one, \"8MM\", from the same writer, is also pretty good. But I think this one takes the cake. Other cop dramas with Morgan Freeman (\"Along Came a Spider\", for example) are also well written. But again, this takes it. The blend of action, humor, dark grisly death and literary intelligence is just superb in its smooth mixture. What other serial killer is using Dante and \"Paradise Lost\" as a guidebook? Can I again say the supporting cast is good? Paltrow almost never fails to impress, and this is one of her more vulnerable roles -- a dainty flower in a hurricane. Ermey is his typical authoritarian self, but more reserved here, to his credit. And Roundtree is at the peak of his career, as well -- this may not be \"Shaft\", but I think he comes across as a serious actor here in a way he never has before.As anyone will tell you, this film is ranked in the top fifty for a good reason: it is a stellar film. If you do not mind a little blood and plenty of curse words, you will love the intricate and well-woven plot here. I recently watched the film again -- possibly my fifth time now -- and it only grows better with repeat viewings.

Basically two homicide detectives are partnered to investigate a series of homicides. They are soon-to-retire Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and short-tempered but enthusiastic replacement Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), who has recently moved to the city with his wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). The murders are inspired by the seven deadly sins: Gluttony (overindulgence and overconsumption), Greed (or Avarice, the desire and pursuit of material possessions), Sloth (habitual disinclination to exertion, or laziness), Pride (or Vanity, the irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments), Lust (or Lechery, intense longing), Envy (jealousy for another person's good fortune) and Wrath (or Anger, uncontrolled feelings of rage, even hatred). A man was forced to eat until his stomach ruptured, representing Gluttony, and a defence attorney was killed after a pound of flesh was taken from him, representing Greed. Clues at the murder scenes lead them to a suspect's apartment, where they find the third victim, a child molester and drug dealer, strapped to bed and starved to death, representing Sloth. Photographs of the third victim were taken over a year ago, showing that the crimes were planned far in advance. Somerset and Mills use various literal sources to identify anything related to the seven deadly sins, including John Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno, and through library records they identify a man called Jonathan \"John\" Doe, and track him to his apartment. Does flees as they arrive, Mills gives chase, Doe holds him at gunpoint for a moment before escaping. After breaking into the apartment, Mills and Somerset find it contains hundreds of notebooks revealing the psychotic nature of Doe, as well as a clue to another murder. The detectives arrive too late to stop a man forced to kill a prostitute by raping her with a custom-made bladed strap-on, representing Lust. The following day the fifth victim, a female model is found dead with her face mutilated, Doe gave her the choice of calling for help and living disfigured, or committing suicide by taking pills, representing Pride. As Somerset and Mills return to the station, John Doe (Kevin Spacey) turns himself in, covered in the blood of an unidentified victim, he cannot be properly identified, as he has removed his own fingerprints, meaning he literally is \"John Doe\" (anonymous). Doe offers to take the detectives to the final two victims, but only under specific terms, or he will plead insanity, Somerset is wary, but Mills agrees. The detectives follow Doe's directions to a remote desert location, while a helicopter follows them. Soon after their arrival, a delivery van approaches, Mills holds Doe at gunpoint while Somerset stops the van, the driver has been instructed to deliver a box to them. Doe taunts Mills by telling him how he admires and is jealous of his life with Tracy, he himself is representing Envy. Somerset opens the box, he is shocked by its contents and warns Mills to stay back, Doe states that he killed Tracy, her head is in the box, and he reveals that she was pregnant. Despite warning Mills that Doe will win if he kills him, Mills shoots Doe, fulfilling the final murder, and himself representing Wrath, in the end the devastated Mills is taken away. Also starring Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Police Captain, Scrubs' John C. McGinley as the California SWAT team leader, Richard Roundtree as District Attorney Martin Talbot, Richard Schiff as Mark Swarr, Mark Boone Junior as Greasy FBI Man, Reg E. Cathey as Dr. Santiago and Speed's Hawthorne James as George the Night Guard at the Library. Freeman is great as the dignified and credible detective on the brink of retirement, and he is equally matched by the raw but idealistic Pitt, Paltrow is alright in her short time, and Spacey steals the last few scenes as the psychopathic killer. This is a really clever and sophisticated postmodern movie, the script and narrative is daring, the murders and violence are disturbing, you follow the mystery unfolding, there is a jump or two along the way (the man strapped to the bed thought to be dead suddenly waking is a good one), the use of dark colouring and underlighting adds to the bleakness, and the twist ending is fantastic, it is just a marvellous must see crime thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Brad Pitt was number 15, Morgan Freeman number 27, and Kevin Spacey number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 The World's Greatest Actors, and the film was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments.

Keven Spacey, as the serial killer (there seems to be no end of them), takes them seriously enough to track down good examples of each and execute them according to their cardinal traits. For instance, he ties an obese man into a chair and force feeds him until he is the size of the puking man in \"Monty Python's Meaning of Life,\" and then kicks him until he explodes. The older I get and the more the flesh sags, the less amusing I find this concept.The murders, by the way, are pretty disgusting, what with the darkness lighted by tiny candles, the flies buzzing around, the mutilated and decomposing corpses, the severed body parts, and all that.Particularly horrifying are the last two of the seven killings. One involves an excess of envy and the other of anger. I don't want to give much more away, but they involve Spacey himself and one of the two detectives (Freeman and Pitt). The incident is a most unexpected twist, and a plausible one. That's what I meant in describing this as well written. As an unintended bonus there is an exchange between the detectives, in 1995. Freeman has just bribed an FBI man for a list of library records. Certain books are flagged and when someone checks them out, the users records are fed into the Bureau's data base. Pitt: \"Wait a minute now. How is this legal?\" Freeman: \"Legal, illegal, these terms don't apply here.\"Freeman and Pitt are the usual mismatched cops at the beginning, but this is not a mismatched buddy movie by any means. Half-way through and their few differences are resolved in a reasonable manner.Pitt doesn't do a bad job, and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as usual. What a fine actor he is. Ordinarily he's rock solid but then watch him as a murderous pimp in \"Street Smart\" to get an idea of his range. And the movie simply would not be all that it is without Gwyneth Paltrow. She is a gangly blond with features so delicate that a viewer gets the impression that the slightest kiss on her cheek might leave a memorial bruise. That's important, for reasons I won't go into. The scene in the cafe in which she helplessly asks a helpless Freeman for advice about her secret pregnancy could have been either cloying or unnecessary if it had been written clumsily, but it was not. We can feel the actors meshing like gear wheels during the conversation.If I had a problem it was with the lights. I wish someone had bothered to turn them on. Okay, a murder scene in a shabby apartment could be dark. But why is the PRECINCT STATION as gloomy as a Bohemian bar? I realize this underlighting is fashionable -- damn \"The X Files\" -- but it's getting tiresome to see people running around during action scenes carrying flashlights. While I'm complaining I might as well mention that the score, though brooding, is loud, obtrusive, and generic. Under the opening credits it passes through the obtrusive barrier into irritating, as are the credits themselves, which are shaky and resemble the deliberate but sloppy scrawl of a kindergardener. Every scene is underlined by edgy music except one in which Freeman pokes around in the library, when the composer uses the rapturous Air on a G String, the most accessible piece Bach ever wrote. The very well done library scene reminded me of college one hundred years ago when students had ideals. During exam week the student radio station would play nothing but suitable classical music. You could walk across the quad and hear Bach coming from two dozen open windows, a 24.0 sound system.That's a minor carp though. The is a genuinely good example of the genre. Another thriller about a serial murderer, but a good example still."},{"username":"ccthemovieman-1","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4445210","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1518895","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"11 November 2006","rate":"8","helpful":"18 out of 35 found this helpful.","title":"The Good & Bad Of 'Se7en'","content":"I am shocked that I watch, much less own, this movie, and as often as I do. It's so dark, so uncomfortable to watch in many spots and so profane (although I use a TV Guardian) that it's not a very likable story and film.....but I find it fascinating. Let's continue on with the bad, and the good, of this film - at least from my vantage point.THE BAD - As a Christian, I get tired of seeing the villains, the sickest of serial killers, portrayed as Christians. It's unbelievable Hollywood bias that would never be tolerated if minorities were the constant victim of this kind of prejudice. In case, you don't get the message they even pass by a brightly-lit neon cross in the guy's room! That, and another cheap shot about a Southern Baptist being the killer, and comments about the sicko \"preaching a sermon\" plus Kevin Spacey's talks about people's sins....all are designed to portray a sick killer as a religious nutcase. Also, for further Liberal slants, good-guy Morgan Freeman is talking to Gywneth Paltrow at a neighborhood diner and he relates having talked an old girlfriend into having an abortion which Freeman says, \"to this day, I am positive it was the right move.\" Yet, he also says it was a mistake and he regrets it. Huh?? Other negatives include too many f-words and usages of the Lord's name in vain, mos of them said by Brad Pitt. There are also several really, really downright gross scenes in here. If you don't expect them, you can easily be shocked with these disturbing images: some very sick pictures of tortured and mutilated bodies.THE GOOD - Despite all of the above, the story - as shocking and sordid as it is - is a fascinating one. It gets you so involved that it's almost impossible to put down, even with the unpleasant scenes. The finale is memorable, too. I also appreciated the wonderful cinematography in here. There are some strange colors in here but it all looks fantastic on the special-edition DVD. Spacey was relative unknown in his acting career at this time was riveting in that final 30 minutes when he had his speaking lines. All the actors in here are excellent. This is a film that is impossible to forget.OVERALL - As a friend once told me, \"This movie is very disturbing.\" It's also extremely interesting, but beware it's not easy to watch."},{"username":"BA_Harrison","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2564423","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"11 February 2012","rate":"9","helpful":"3 out of 5 found this helpful.","title":"This ain't a seven: it's got to be at least an eight or a nine.","content":"I consider David Fincher's Seven to be a precursor/forerunner of the 'torture porn' phenomenon—more specifically, the Saw movies: it utilises the grunge aesthetic that has become synonymous with such films, features a self-righteous villain who delights in playing gruesome games, revels in the extreme nature of its victims' suffering, and delivers an uncompromising and rather preposterous finale that is designed to hit like a kick to the gut.However, despite being the impetus for what has become one the most over-saturated and tiresome of sub-genres (as well as that irritating trend of replacing letters in a title with numbers), I don't resent Fincher's film one bit: it's just too good to hold a grudge against—a masterpiece of the macabre that admittedly requires a little suspension of disbelief to be truly effective, but which is so well crafted and so horrific that to do so is both easy and worthwhile.Fincher is able to successfully brush off the debacle that was Alien 3 and prove himself to be the accomplished movie-maker that many suspected him to be. Without studio interference, he successfully delivers his vision—a visually stunning chiller that delivers thrills, chills, grisly horror aplenty, without resorting to cheap scares or overtly explicit gore. Despite its gruesome subject matter, Se7en doesn't rely on relentless splatter to shock: the mere suggestion of what has occurred possesses the power to repel, with brief glimpses of the murder victims' corpses offering just enough grisly detail to satisfy the viewer's morbid curiosity.An ingenious script from Andrew Kevin Walker, impeccable performances from its amazing cast (including a particularly outstanding performance from Kevin Spacey), and what what has to be one of most harrowing and unsettling endings in cinema, all adds up to one hell of a fine movie."},{"username":"moonspinner55","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0989035","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1186034","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"3 October 2005","rate":"6","helpful":"19 out of 30 found this helpful.","title":"It cuts and slices away, but still follows police-movie formula...","content":"Is Morgan Freeman our greatest living actor? He may in fact be, and his mere presence here (solid, noble, and pure) is reassuring, but even Freeman can't overcome the usual cat-&-mouse/killer-toying-with-detectives stew that \"Se7en\" serves up. There's a serial killer loose in rainy New York City, and as he mounts his seven grisly crime scenes--modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins--he quickly becomes aware of the two homicide detectives on the case and is enamored of their drive and determination. Most of this is left vague and unexplained; we learn precious little about the psychopath involved except that he's highly literate, educated, with too much strict religion in his background. This is all hoary police-movie fodder, as is the set-up with the detectives: the wise codger about to retire and his cocky new partner with the short fuse. The film mounts the tension well, with staccato glimpses of corpses and gore, but can't escape a fatigued sense of deja vu (I thought mostly of \"The Silence of the Lambs\"). Brad Pitt gets off to an awkward, hesitant start in his role, but does improve. Freeman is sensational; whether throwing his knife at a dartboard or studying up on literature at the library, he is focused and gripping. The grimy, lust-and-death soaked atmosphere is wallowed in (it's the Big Apple as a Gothic Hell), and certainly it is palpable and captured successfully, but completely off-putting. Words written in blood on the walls...it's too much like real-life crime scenes, and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker isn't clever enough to distract us or cunning enough to help us distinguish the difference (the killer does leave clues, but they are quickly solved). The narrative is a mix of derivative movie-thriller ideas and new-fangled ways of making the viewer as squeamish as possible--it's the old pulling-wings-off-flies number, but on a larger sick-making scale. The film is predictably gruesome, less predictably formula-bound. **1/2 from ****"},{"username":"TxMike","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1298236","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"22 February 2006","rate":"","helpful":"1 out of 3 found this helpful.","title":"Modern film noir, Freeman and Pitt are good as detectives.","content":"Don't worry, there are no spoilers until after the clear warning near the end of my comments. Brad Pitt is a new Detective in town, David Mills, sure of himself and fiery. A crime scene is found and he is paired with a veteran about to retire, Morgan Freeman as Detective William Somerset. The crime is a very overweight man sitting at a table, feet and hands tied, apparently forced to eat until he burst. Gluttony. One of the 7 deadly sins that seem to motivate the mysterious killer. As soon as they figure that out, the hunt takes on a new dimension.Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tracy Mills, young wife of David, and not sure she wants to be in the big city. Things begin unpleasantly for them after they move into their new apartment and find that several passing trains a day rattle everything in the place, and causes their old-fashioned vinyl records to skip.Much of the interest of the movie are the two characters played by Freeman and Pitt, the seasoned man of reason and the young volatile and impatient one. There are gruesome scenes and not a movie for the faint of heart. Or the squeamish.MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. The so-called John Doe (excellent Kevin Spacey role) is smart and drops hints, enough that they eventually track him down and almost capture him at his apartment building. Things inside confirm they have the right man. But before they catch him, and with 5 sin crimes committed, he surprises everyone by turning himself in. But he will show them the last bodies only if Mills and Somerset take him to a certain location. Once there, at a very isolated place, a delivery truck drives up, a box for Mills, it is his wife's head, and the John Doe killer expects to be the 7th victim himself, as Mills gets so enraged that he shoots him. He does, mission accomplished."},{"username":"dbdumonteil","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1219578","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370866","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"4 June 2003","rate":"8","helpful":"3 out of 6 found this helpful.","title":"Devil (Kevin Spacey) is seven!","content":"\"Seven\" by David Fincher: a movie that attracted a lot of attention and made Fincher go down in history. His efforts devoted to this very original thriller were rewarded since it was one of the most successful movies made in 1995. \"Seven\" is probably one of the peaks of the film noir. It's based on a clever and especially devilish screenplay. This devilish side is particularly obvious by certain moments during the movie (notably the end): when Kevin Spacey (the killer) is leaving some clues at places where he committed his murders. He's leaving clues so that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt can pick up his trail but he's also mocking at police. Moreover, can we really consider the end as a happy-end. Freeman, once says: \"this isn't going to have a happy-end\". He's partly true. Spacey died but he managed to achieve his grim intention and he broke Pitt's life. When you look at his face in the last pictures, you might think he went mad...The movie is also wrapped in a sordid, dreary even stifling atmosphere. The kinds of feelings you must feel by living such a story. Like \"Psycho\" by Alfred Hitchcock, by moments, the movie is plunged into horror (the discovery of the murders).At last, a dazzling performance comes to crown it all: a confident and a tiny bit conceited Brad Pitt teams up with a wistful and disillusioned Morgan Freeman. Both makes a perfect duet. And I think Kevin Spacey's performance is definitely his best one to date.A thriller sometimes violent but always entrancing."},{"username":"Quinoa1984","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0453068","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370528","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"17 October 2000","rate":"10","helpful":"2 out of 3 found this helpful.","title":"Disturbingly effective, for two audiences","content":"A while back I thought after seeing Seven that this is a film gets in the crowd of the macabre disturbing films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, etc. It does and then it doesn't as well. It has that kind of horrific core on display of humanities ills alongside the violent nature. But it is also a Hollywood thriller, with big stars, and on that level it's just as affecting and successful. It's almost like a crossover film by having this mystery-investigation side of the story, led by Putt and Freeman, while the investigation itself making it pretty clear its no-holds-barred moments. Fincher's work as a director here is absolute in making style serve the story.It does this and more by making grissly images of cruelness and dark vibes that would make Nosferatu cringe (slightly). Story follows aging detective (Freeman in one of his better roles) and new detective (Pitt does OK here, too) who hunt down a killer who is doing it in according to the 7 deadly sins. Nailbitting all the way to the end, even when we find out the John Doe (and if your on this site, you know Kevin Spacey plays one of the most clever villains in recent thriller history). Entertaining, and with an everlasting appeal that has spawned on a series of lesser films (i.e. Saw), and still holding up just as strong ten+ years later."},{"username":"wes-connors","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15896852","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2133662","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"28 September 2009","rate":"8","helpful":"1 out of 2 found this helpful.","title":"Paradise Lost","content":"Two detectives, retiring veteran Morgan Freeman (as William Somerset) and hotshot rookie Brad Pitt (as David Mills), team up to trail a serial killer chalking up victims as an homage to the \"Seven Deadly Sins\" - \"Gluttony\", \"Greed\", \"Sloth\", \"Lust\", \"Pride\", \"Envy\", and \"Wrath\". Don't read anything more about this film; I didn't, and still had it figured out during the final road trip. That it's fairly predictable, and presents two \"stock\" characters, doesn't mean \"Seven\" (\"SE7EN\" if you use all caps) is a bad trip.In fact, it's an excellent film, with a stylish look created by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji, from writer Andrew Kevin Walker's intriguing story. Strangely, only film editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an \"Academy Award\". And, there were no acting \"Oscars\". Hopefully, Mr. Freeman just missed getting nominated for \"Best Actor\"; he certainly deserved to be, for his sharply focused take on the character type also happens to precisely reflect the mood of the piece.******** Seven (9/22/95) David Fincher ~ Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Paltrow"},{"username":"michaelRokeefe","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0449021","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0370782","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"15 July 2002","rate":"5","helpful":"3 out of 16 found this helpful.","title":"Alarming.

So it is with some interest that I check if what I have seen was what the director thought he put there. Often, I find them simply working on intuition. But the better performing artists are different. They must always intend -- if they do not intend a specific feel or effect then it simply is not there. That's why when a DVD commentary involves an actor it is of particular interest.In this DVD, we hear Pitt, who really commits to delivering, who worries, who prepares, who sublimates self in order to create an image of himself in your mind. And we hear Freeman who is arrogant, demanding of you and not of him, offering a here-I-am take-it-or-leave-it style of acting, which he calls `intuitive.' This really explains a lot for me. It's why Freeman is a negative attractor for any film I consider, and Pitt the other way around.Either way, Spacey is the only one that connects with his character, and he's given a relatively simple job. I admit that this story moved well, engaging by shock and unexpected moves when I first saw it. But on repeated viewings, substantial sloppiness gets in the way. What remains is the very fine lighting. I think `Fight Club,' was much the superior film. This one hardly rates any celebration."}],"errorMessage":""}
