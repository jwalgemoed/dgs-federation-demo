It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages."},{"username":"SnoopyStyle","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4809175","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"27 April 2019","rate":"8","helpful":"24 out of 63 found this helpful.","title":"Back to the Future or not","content":"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny \"The Dude\" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like \"I don't like how she looks\". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes."},{"username":"Horst_In_Translation","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3914439","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4835536","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"7 May 2019","rate":"6","helpful":"39 out of 104 found this helpful.","title":"Not as amazing as the previous, but still pretty much worth watching","content":"\"Avengers: Endgame\" is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don't need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean \"all\", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre.Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don't mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner's character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I'm gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America's personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We'll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee's final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace.Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won't return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before."},{"username":"Prismark10","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4569900","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4816308","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"29 April 2019","rate":"7","helpful":"16 out of 46 found this helpful.","title":"It certainly is the end game","content":"The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on."},{"username":"bob the moo","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1002035","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4906293","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"2 June 2019","rate":"","helpful":"25 out of 40 found this helpful.","title":"Plot holes and other blockbuster weaknesses, but it is impressive in how well it lands this huge beast in a way that satisfies and delivers","content":"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing."},{"username":"nogodnomasters","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77881167","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4816351","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"29 April 2019","rate":"9","helpful":"17 out of 49 found this helpful.","title":"6 stones 3 teams 1 shot","content":"Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson).

But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even \"copied\" or \"homaged\" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is \"slow\", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is \"technically sound\" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway.

And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie's current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb's list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and \"Avengers: Endgame\" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I've written about it before in my reviews, so I don't want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn't really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.So rather than being a complete killjoy, I thought the movie was good for what it was, but it took quite a stretch to bring back the characters who went missing following Infinity War. The plot utilizes the time worn (no pun intended), time travel gimmick to hurl the principal heroes back to three (or four) different pasts in order to undo the havoc created by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his destructive use of the Infinity Stones. For once, one of the characters, can't remember who it was, stated that going into the past is really creating a new future, so that the present reality eventually becomes the past. I liked that because if you think it through, that's exactly correct. But in so doing, a whole lot gets muddled as the story progresses, and the idea that Thanos 'used the stones to destroy the stones' makes everything that follows feel like the writers making it up as they went along. Which of course, is what they did, but you know what I mean.There are a lot of huh? moments in the picture - fat Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is one - why? Thor cutting off Thanos's head another - too easy, why not any time prior? Stuff like that demeans credibility and took me out of the picture for a moment. Captain America (Chris Evans) battling himself? Doctor Strange's (Benedict Cumberbatch) circular reasoning - \"If I tell you what happens, it won't happen\". Enough stuff like this makes it all a bit muddled to follow, especially when things reach a fever pitch and the last hour descends into a gigantic free for all.But there were interesting elements in the picture. I liked what the writers did with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), even if he didn't go into 'Smash' mode much. The fully functioning time/space GPS conjured up by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was kind of nifty, Elon Musk will probably start working on that any day now. I take with a few grains of salt that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) died at the end, because, you know, no one dies in the comic book world and lives to tell about it. See, I could be a film writer too. Best of all, I'm glad the film makers got a chance to insert Stan Lee into that 1970 time line scene, because he's my favorite Marvel character, and even though he's not around any more, he'll live on as a result of all his story writing and Marvel movie appearances.In summation, by all means, see the movie, but keep things in perspective. I may see things differently after watching it a second or third time, but right now, my initial reaction is tempered with some reservation. It didn't help that there was no after credits scene, but I guess that was the point. What comes next is anybody's guess."},{"username":"jboothmillard","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4248714","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4831783","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"6 May 2019","rate":"9","helpful":"10 out of 33 found this helpful.","title":"Avengers: Endgame","content":"So, it all came to this, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the most financially and commercially successful superhero franchise for the last 12 years, and this was the conclusion to the Avengers storyline, the most anticipated, and highest-grossing movie of 2019 (it made $2 billion in 11 days, faster than Avatar, and surpassed the record of Titanic), it's the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically half of all life on Earth was disintegrated by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the Infinity Gauntlet. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rescues Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who were stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan. They reunite with the remaining Avengers: Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). They plan to retake the Infinity Stones and reverse the disintegrations, they locate and confront Thanos, but find that he has destroyed the Stones, in anger Thor kills Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is returned (by chance) from the quantum realm to find the world devastated and half of the population disappeared in a snap. Scott finds Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have vanished but finds his daughter Cassie (Emma Fuhrmann) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, Rogers is attending grief counselling sessions for survivors still struggling following the wipe out, while Romanoff is at the Avengers' compound tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, and Nebula. Lang returns to the compound; he explains that five years had only five hours for him in the quantum realm and theorises that it may be possible to build a time machine to reverse the annihilation. Stark refuses to help out of fear that he will lose his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), who was born after the disintegration, but he talks with his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and does his own experiments. Banner has embraced the Hulk part of him, and melded himself and Hulk together as one, he agrees that it is possible to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Banner and Rocket travel to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the last survivors of Asgard have settled, they are shocked to Thor overwhelmed by guilt, with overgrown hair and overweight, eating junk, drinking, and playing video games with his friends Korg (Taika Waititi) and Miek, but they eventually convince him to return. Romanoff recruits Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), now a ruthless vigilante after his family was disintegrated. Initial experiments with the time machine with Lang go awry, but Stark arrives to shows them his findings to perfect it, and testing it with Barton, it is confirmed that it works. The Avengers plan which places in time to travel to where the five Infinity Stones are located. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to the battle of New York City in 2012 (Avengers Assemble) to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, after battling with himself. Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape with the Space Stone. But Stark remembers the Space Stone being in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, he and Rogers travel back to retrieve it, Rogers sights Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Stark has a meaningful conversation with his father Howard (John Slattery). Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013 (Thor: The Dark World) to extract the Reality Stone from Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while there Thor has a conversation with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo), as it is the day she will be killed, which he cannot reverse, and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 (Guardians of the Galaxy) and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula is unable to return, her cybernetic interface has connected with that of her past self. Through this connection, the past version of Thanos learns of his future success and the plan of the Avengers to undo it. Thanos captures Nebula and sends past Nebula to the present day disguised as her future self. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in the same year and learn that the Soul Stone requires the death of a loved one, they argue which of them should sacrifice themselves, but ultimately Romanoff falls to her death, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the five Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet, reasoning that he can withstand the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the Stones. The snap of Banner's fingers is successful, all those disintegrated are resurrected, and one of the two of the group reunite with loved ones. However, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport past Thanos and his warship to the present, he attacks the Avengers compound. Nebula convinces past Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to turn against Thanos, and kills her past self, while Stark, Rogers and Thor battle Thanos. Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives with other sorcerers, the Avengers: T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the Guardians of the Galaxy: Drax (Dave Bautista) and Groot (Vin Diesel), and the armies of Wakanda, Asgard, and the Ravagers. The fight between good and evil begins, Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, and Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from his hand to his own, clicks his fingers, turning Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from radioactive overexposure to the Stones. A funeral is held for Stark, with all the Avengers, including leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and all other associated characters, attending. Barton and Wanda take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision did not return in the snap. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard, he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original time lines, but after doing so, he chose to remain in the past to live a full life. Rogers appears before Wilson and his friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as an old man, he passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson, and a flashback reveals that he finally found happiness with Peggy Carter. By the way, there is no post-credits sequence, only some sound effects. Also starring Benedict Wong as Wong, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Agent Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada as Akihiko, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, James D'Arcy as Jarvis, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Ross Marquand as Red Skull (Stonekeeper) and a posthumous cameo by Stan Lee as a 1970s Driver. You will almost not notice or care about the three hour running time, it is a story in three acts: the devastation of the world, time travelling to reverse it all, and the battle to save the world, the cast playing the superheroes and the villains are all great, it is the characters that really add to it all, it has good humour, it has amazing special effects, fight sequences and spectacle, and it gets you emotionally as well, a fantastic and fitting conclusion to the saga, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects.

And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that \"Avengers: Endgame\" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let's just go with 'wow'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you'd have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in \"Avengers: Endgame\" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie's outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren't going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren't really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was \"Avengers: Endgame\" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then \"Avengers: Endgame\" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating \"Avengers: Endgame\" a six out of ten stars."},{"username":"BA_Harrison","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4825189","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"3 May 2019","rate":"7","helpful":"11 out of 37 found this helpful.","title":"Forget Captain Marvel... meet The Rat!","content":"After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...)."},{"username":"TxMike","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5082590","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"26 August 2019","rate":"","helpful":"3 out of 17 found this helpful.","title":"A continuation of \"Infinity War\", Thanos has to be dealt with and it takes all Avengers.","content":"My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched \"Infinity War\" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing.

Then again, I'm going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It's a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There's been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they're above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today's politics, I'm not going to change anyone's mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can't you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that's fine. You can ignore it if you like - we've never lived in a time where there's more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I've seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I've seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another's company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it's already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that's bigger than us. That's what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here's where I get into major plot points. You've been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn't Black Widow's, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I've always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America's longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor's descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn't save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero's journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony's quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor's moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill's way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they've been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it's one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven't heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he's able to lift Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, \"I am Iron Man,\" which are also his last words. There's just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I'm that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I'm never going to convince you that this is a good movie."},{"username":"tavm","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11228318","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4856949","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"16 May 2019","rate":"10","helpful":"34 out of 157 found this helpful.","title":"Avengers: Endgame was a great way to end the first series of the Marvel Cinematic Univeerse","content":"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08.

The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival.

You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say \"oh no those are all terrible\", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking.

In what was originally titled \"Avengers: Infinity War Part 2\", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it's colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it's difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don't offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic's classic \"Dear Mr. Fantasy\" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by 'Infinity War', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we've come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you've never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that's the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we've gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It's quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a 'women's movement' moment that seems to be Marvel's \"we hear you\" statement. Much of what we see is \"inevitable\", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when 'over-the-top' is 'just right'."},{"username":"Wuchakk","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4409266","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4978738","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"5 July 2019","rate":"6","helpful":"6 out of 21 found this helpful.","title":"How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?","content":"How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \"Infinity War\" weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \"Back to the Future II\" (1989).\"Endgame\" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long.

It delivers on a grandiose scale, almost delusional, but its awe-inspiring stuff.You know not to read any spoilers, and unfortunately they are so easy to find, but everyone knows not to.But rest assured, it left me stunned, satisfied and teary eyed.Marvel have done something epic, and there will not be a film like this around for a very long time."}],"errorMessage":""}
