Let me explain. While the film is excellent it also is unpleasant, violent, filled with expletives (particularly the old f-bomb) and has nothing but unlikable characters. For me, films like this, \"Good Fellas\" and \"The Fight Club\" are just pretty nasty films--but still, they are quality films--unpleasant quality films. The film is a very confusing story about a gang of five guys who meet in the oddest way--at a police lineup! The five decide to get together for an illegal job and soon end up being extorted to do a job for 'Keyser Soze'-- man who no one seems to know but who inspires fear in those who hear his name (sort of like Valdemort). I'd say more, but frankly I don't want to ruin the film. Suffice to say, it's a film with a BIG twist--like \"The Fight Club\" or \"The Crying Game\" and so I'll stop with that.The bottom line is if you like violent films with very graphic violence and language, then \"The Usual Suspects\" is for you. The acting, writing and directing are great. If you would rather see films a bit more uplifting or family-friendly, do NOT see this film!

Simply put, 'The Usual Suspects' is a magnificent film all round that deserves to be re-watched over and over again, one of the few films seen recently to not find any fault with it. Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.Film is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.It has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.Overall, magnificent film in every sense. Recommended with no hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox"},{"username":"bkoganbing","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2483625","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2042996","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"25 March 2009","rate":"9","helpful":"9 out of 16 found this helpful.","title":"A Gang Formed During A Police Lineup","content":"Five hoodlums are hauled into a police station in a dragnet roundup of The Usual Suspects that are brought in for questioning when something big breaks. Good chance any one or all could have been involved. If you remember in the film The Brink's Job, there is a scene where within a day a lot of Boston's known hoodlums are brought in for questioning. The dragnet brought in Stephen Baldwin, Bernicio DelToro, Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak. From this motley crew a gang is born.Flash forward to several years later when there is a horrific fire on board a freighter where there has been a gun battle with many deaths. Kevin Spacey managed to survive along with two others of the freighter crew and is being questioned in the police station by US Customs Agent Chazz Palmenteri and LA cop Dan Hedaya.After a couple of other jobs, this crew winds up working for a criminal mastermind from the Balkans who is known as Keyser Sose who is known to be so ruthless that the criminal population itself is scared to death. This guy is spoken of like he was Satan himself and of course the police want him big time also.I can't say much more because the plotting of The Usual Suspects is so intricate and filled with unexpected twists that to spoil this film would be a crime itself. Some here like Stephen Baldwin give their best performances on screen. Kevin Spacey won his first Oscar, this one in the Best Supporting Actor category. The category has me stumped because it's his character that's the key to the whole film. The other Oscar The Usual Suspects won was for Christopher McQuarrie for one highly original Screenplay.The Usual Suspects has enough action for those who crave that, especially when we do see the final battle on that freighter and it's also some highly literate dialog for those who appreciate that. It's best compared to that granddaddy of all caper films The Asphalt Jungle, it's that good."},{"username":"SnoopyStyle","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2936445","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"6 January 2014","rate":"10","helpful":"7 out of 8 found this helpful.","title":"Then comes the twist","content":"Death and mayhem comes to the docks.

I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened.

Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason.

And man, did it deliver. It won both Oscars (including one for McQuarrie) it was nominated for and, as of this day, stands on #26 of IMDb's highest rated films of all time. There's a good chance that, after you've watched The Usual Suspects, you may feel the urge to see it again not much after to focus on details you did not concentrate on during the first viewing. This is easily one of the best examples ever of how an unexpected ending can raise the quality of a film in the viewer's mind and even carry the one who came up with it to Oscar glory. Of course, that is not to say that everything that happened in the roughly 90 minutes before the final twist is rather forgettable. It certainly is not. It's a nice buildup.As for me, I was not too impressed with the whole story. What I did like, however, were the performances. Awards-wise, Spacey was the only standout, but almost the complete cast portrayed their characters convincingly. Spacey shines as the weak cripple whose skills in coordination and planning make him a valuable addition to the team. Pete Postlethwaite is second to none in the very few scenes he has and a truly magnetic presence. The look he gives Byrne's character out of the conference room is one of the highlights, just like the whole elevator/kidnapping scene before. And last but not least, said Gabriel Byrne delivers a great performance as an ex-cop, ex-criminal stuck between both worlds now. The way he portrays his inner conflict and his interactions with Spacey's character elevate the material a lot. When it came to the mysterious Keyser Söze, I'm not sure how many of his scenes were really so memorable because of the quality or just because of the crassness. I'm mostly referring to the flashback including his family here. Nonetheless, the character is known to stand for an invisible evil force in pop culture talk to this day, soon 20 years later, and that's surely an impressive achievement.I recommend this film, if there's even anybody out there who still hasn't seen it. I don't think it's as good as its rating on this website suggests, but it's still a fairly entertaining 100 minutes, especially if cop/crime stories are among your genre preferences."},{"username":"claudio_carvalho","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2488512","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3878289","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"10 December 2017","rate":"9","helpful":"7 out of 11 found this helpful.","title":"Who is Keyser Söze?","content":"After a bloodbath and fire on a moored ship only the badly burned Hngarian mobster Arkosh Kovash (Morgan Hunter) and the crippled small- time crook Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey) survive. Agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) interrogates Verbal that explains what happened to Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and him in the vessel. Six weeks ago, they met each other at the line-up in the police station and decide to team-up for a heist under the command of the former corrupt cop Keaton. After delivering the jewels to the fence Redfoot (Peter Greene), they are hired for another heist and then the lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite) approaches to them and tell that the notorious Hungarian gangster Keyser Söze had offered them to go to the ship to destroy the cocaine they are transporting. They go to the ship and do not find any drug, and Keyser Söze killed each one of them. Who is Keyser Söze?Twenty-two years after the releasing date, \"The Usual Suspects\" is still a great film that has not aged. The impact reduces a little if the viewer still recalls who Keyser Söze is, but the film is still one of the best of the genre. Kevin Spacey was not well-known and Bryan Singer was in the beginning of his career, but the direction and performances are top-notch. The screenplay is one of the best written in the cinema history for a mystery film and the result is a fantastic movie.

During the questioning the survivor, Verbal Kint, tells of how events came to happen. Five criminals are brought together in a line up and decide to use the events to plan a job. However another survivor tells an extra story \u0096 one involving master criminal Kyser Soze. Kint reveals how the gang were forced into the fateful job by Soze \u0096 however who is Soze and why did the men try to steal what appears to be a ship load of drugs that didn't exist?When I first saw this I saw it in the cinema \u0096 the very next day I went back and watched it again. The plot starts with a cliff hanger and appears to gradually answer the mystery - however what it actually does is create more questions for every answer it appears to give. It does this without frustrating you or without confusing the issue \u0096 in fact you don't know right till the end that you've been caught in a story teller's web. The plot unfolds like a normal thriller but it is anything but.The strength of the film is in the writing but it is the direction that also manages to create a great mood. Singer uses clever shots weaving the story into a believable web of deceit. The cast add quality to every single line, every single scene. It's hard to imagine that the film could be the same with any one person changed.Bryne is great as Keaton, his world weary cop drawn into a plan he can't control \u0096 or is he the master behind it all. Spacey gives a great performance as our eyes and ears as he retells the events, he deservedly won an Oscar for this role \u0096 before he got all soft and started becoming a starring man. Baldwin has the film of his life (albeit not hard!), he's really good and should be lucky to get another good role. Even the minor roles in the gang are great \u0096 Del Toro's performance is even better when you knew why he did it that way. Likewise Pollack will never have a better role \u0096 he has genuine tension between him and Baldwin (even in later interviews the dislike still seems real \u0096 with things like Pollack telling Baldwin he's sorry that his brothers stole all the food from his table). Palminteri does a great performance and is totally convincing. Postlethwaite is good despite playing an Asian (?) lawyer. Suzi Amis is good in her brief role and Esposito is as good as he always is.Overall I could talk for hours about this film. It's rare for films now to have decent plots worth talking about however this manages it \u0096 it's still twisty and impressive no matter how many times you watch it."},{"username":"kosmasp","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6568870","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"6 February 2021","rate":"10","helpful":"1 out of 2 found this helpful.","title":"More than usual","content":"Another day, another rewatch.

That's the brilliance of \"The Usual Suspects\", a film with a twist ending that leaves you shaking your head and going 'Whoa! well past the finale. Here's how I see it - A lot of comments on this film revile it for being a story that never happened because of the reveal at the end. But that's not really the case. Following the opening scene, the picture flashes back to the police lineup that brought five petty hoods together. Well, three of them were petty; Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Verbal Kint are much more than they seem. The emerald heist of the NYPD 'taxi service' and the ripoff of jeweler Saul Berg were real enough events involving the resources of all five criminals to pull them off. Where the story really takes off is with the introduction of Kobayashi (Pete Postlewaithe). From about that point on, and only in retrospect, do we come to understand that Verbal's story telling skills are meant to obfuscate and defy credibility. He follows up with the legend of Keyser Soze, a mythical Hungarian no one has ever seen (except one Arturo Marquez), who's reputation for fierce vengeance has become as legendary as the man himself is ethereal.That Verbal Kint is a con man is unquestionable. He was pegged with a sixty two thousand dollar swindle at the NYPD lineup, enough to convince McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fenster (Benicio del Toro) and Hockney (Kevin Pollack) that he was in their league, as long as he could convince Keaton to go along. With the disgraced ex-cop vouching for him, Kint was allowed to mastermind the 'blue and white' emerald heist without anyone getting killed. Then came his increased stature by finishing off Saul Berg during the second job. The idea that details like Redfoot, Kobayashi and the Argentinean drug deal were all made up doesn't detract from the fact that Verbal Kint/Keyser Soze had an agenda. That agenda, all the way at the bottom of the totem pole, was the murder of Arturo Marquez, a character mentioned but never seen, a character who might have known the real identity of Keyser Soze.So we know Verbal made up a lot of this stuff on the fly. But what about Kujan? In one moment, Kujan tells Verbal that Keaton was Keyser Soze, and a few sentences later says he doesn't know. Did he make up the story about Edie Finneran (Suzy Amis) being killed? Who would have killed her, and for what reason? Most likely Kobayashi if Marquez could identify Soze. The one thing we can come away with is that Verbal Kint, besides being a fake, is a remorseless, relentless killer, who's con man gig is the ultimate con on movie viewers everywhere. Verbal Kint was Keyser Soze, but the blast of it is - there was NO Keyser Soze - and he's become one of the screen's most intriguing characters of all time."},{"username":"lee_eisenberg","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4888011","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1197044","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"19 October 2005","rate":"10","helpful":"5 out of 11 found this helpful.","title":"The greatest trick the Devil ever played...","content":"\"The Usual Suspects\" made Kevin Spacey a household name, and rightfully so.

Basically there was an explosion on the waterfront of New York, and criminal Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Kevin Spacey) was the only witness, and FBI Agent Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and U.S. Customs special agent Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) wants him to answer their questions about what happened. Through flashbacks Verbal, who suffers cerebral palsy, tells the story of how he and four other con-men were brought into custody as \"the usual suspects\" that could have carried out a truck hijack. In the lineup were former police police officer seemingly giving up crime, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), short-tempered professional thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), his partner Fred Fenster (Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro), hijacker Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Verbal. None of the five men are found guilty of th crime after questioning, and afterwards to get some kind of revenge McManus convinces the others to take part in a robbery targeting the city's finest taxi service. After this they sell the loot in Los Angeles to Redfoot the Fence (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene), who talks them into doing another job, and even though Keaton said the previous one would be his last he agrees anyway. The robbery goes well despite the fact that it was heroin rather than money or jewels, and Redfoot reveals the job came from lawyer Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), who the five thieves meet, he says that he works for Keyser Soze, a renowned but unseen criminal mastermind. Kobayashi blackmails them due to the fact that Soze has been associated with their crimes in the past, he wants them to attack a ship on the San Pedro harbour filled with cocaine. In the present Verbal tells about the legend of Keyser Soze, a criminal feared like the devil who apparently killed his own family when they were threatened, and who no-one has ever seen the face of. Back in flashback, Fenster was killed earlier on when he dropped out, and the four remaining criminals go ahead with this job on the docks, only to realise it is some kind of trap and they are killed one by one, with Verbal and Keaton the last two alive. Of course Verbal explains that he supposedly watched Keaton being shot and burned before the explosion by the mysterious and unseen stranger, possibly Soze, but the officers aren't sure he saw anything properly. Verbal seems to be upset that they believe Keaton is Keyser Soze and may still be out there, and with his bail posted they let Verbal go with his possessions, and he limps away. The ending however is the big bang, when the police officers are relaxing one gazes at the wall of newspaper and photo clippings in the room Kint was being interviewed, and he drops his mug realising everything the conman had been saying was built up around the various words and names on the wall, Verbal as well in seen with his limp disappearing and left arm restored, and diving away with \"Mr. Kobayashi\". The final quote of the film is a repeat of the words Verbal said to the police, and where we realise he really was Keyser Soze, \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" \"And like that, he's gone.\" Also starring Suzy Amis as Edie Finneran and Dan Hedaya as Sgt. Jeffrey 'Jeff' Rabin. All the performances are fantastic, including Byrne and Postlethwaite, but especially of course the mesmerising Spacey who was not a big star back at the time, only known for small roles like Glengarry Glen Ross, he deserved the Oscar, the story is clever with a witty script and some exciting gun play and explosive moments, a good old fashioned and engaging crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. Kevin Spacey was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Verbal Kint was number 48 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Kevin Spacey, a small-time con man, is telling his story of a band of thieves and murderers to an investigator, Chaz Palminteri. The are multiple flashbacks and the transition from the present to the past isn't obvious. What I mean is, you will not see the pages flapping on a desk calendar while harp arpeggios strum in the background. Instead, there are quick cuts back and forth, sometimes with a time and date at the bottom of the screen to help orient us, and it works. We're never confused about when or where we are.I must say, though, that the rules of film making have become a lot more, well -- relaxed over the years. Around 1950 Alfred Hitchcock was taken to task for including what critics called a \"lying flashback\" in \"Stage Fright.\" They were bothered by the fact that Hitchcock used a flashback to illustrate a story being told by Richard Todd and part of the story was false, yet it still appeared in the flashback. Yes, film grammar has changed. Ain't it wonderful? When I said the movie was ambitious I meant that it seemed to strive for a significance greater than that provided by the exploits of a handful of losers. The mysterious villain may or may not be real. He is said to rule just about the entire criminal world. There is nothing he can't or won't do. The movie conjures up Professor Moriarty -- or Macavity the Cat at the least, the Napolean of crime. \"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled,\" says Spacey, \"was convincing us that he doesn't exist.\" Do the ominous shadows cast over the plot by this invocation work? Yes, kind of. We get a sense of the hopelessness of trying to pit ourselves against an irresistible power. It also drains away some of the realism that so many cop movies fuss over. If we don't believe in an arch criminal running the dark universe, then it's hard to believe the plot of this movie. In paying attention to its loftier goals the movie lacks the down-to-earth and familiar quality of stories like \"L.A. Confidential.\" But what the heck. It's a good movie. If it doesn't tell us too much about human nature it gives us characters we get to know a bit about, lots of colorful and well-handled action, and something of a sense of tragedy.

Even now that I've seen is several times I'm not 100% sure what is true and what is misdirection.The cast all do a great job, especially Gabriel Byrne as the charismatic ex-corrupt police officer Dean Keaton who is trying to go straight after a life of crime, Pete Postlethwaite as the mysterious Kobayashi and Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint, a crippled con artist who is explaining what happened to the authorities (and us) what may have happened in the run up to his arrest.The film opens in the aftermath of a battle on a boat in a harbour in Los Angeles, there are only two know survivors; Verbal and a badly burnt Hungarian. Dave Kujan, a US customs officer, is sure that Keaton masterminded the attack and has escaped so he interviews Verbal who has done a deal with the police and is soon to be released. Verbal tells a tale of how the group met up when they were all hauled in by the NYPD for a robbery and put in a line up together. There they plan a job to get back at the police before heading to LA to lie low and to fence their ill-gotten gains. Here they are approached by Kobayashi, a lawyer claiming to work for Keyser Soze, a mysterious character who strikes fear into the hearts of criminals even though none have actually met him. Kobayashi explains that they must do one job for Mr Soze. All this is told us by Verbal so we never really know if he is telling the truth, and if he is lying is it to protect himself, his friend Keaton or perhaps he is just making up a story for his own personal amusement while awaiting release.The story is brilliantly told and it is rightly considered a modern classic, if you haven't seen it yet then I strongly recommend watching it... twice! Although even then you'll not fully understand what has happened."},{"username":"moonspinner55","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0989035","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1708574","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"8 August 2007","rate":"6","helpful":"6 out of 15 found this helpful.","title":"Interesting, engrossing, but might have benefited from a stronger cast","content":"Five disparate men, crooks involved in a drug heist gone awry, have their story unraveled by the sole survivor of the mishap. Colorfully profane screenplay done a disservice by the rather lackluster cast (particularly Chazz Palminteri, who does nothing fresh playing a smug investigator, and Stephen Baldwin as a cocky cut-up). Similarly, the direction also takes a while to warm up, although Kevin Spacey overcomes the awkward handling and won a Supporting Actor Oscar. Spacey, who often strikes an indifferent presence on-screen, is eerily haughty here and almost removed from the surroundings, yet his actorly tics are colorful and he works his hypnotic eyes with quiet drive. The movie has intriguing passages and certainly improves as it continues, but the twisty finish is more outlandish than surprising, especially as you consider all that came before it. **1/2 from ****"},{"username":"TxMike","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2866873","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"10 September 2013","rate":"","helpful":"0 out of 2 found this helpful.","title":"Intriguing script, it pays to watch it more than once.","content":"It is hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. I first saw in in 1999, and several times since then. I have found my overall impressions changing over time. Is it a great movie? That depends entirely on your own preferences in movies. But it certainly has an interesting script and Kevin Spacey is superb as the cripple \"Verbal Kint\".What we have here is a story told from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Not that Kint himself is unreliable, but as one of the five \"usual suspects\", perhaps the only survivor, he tells Agent Dave Kujan ('ku-yawn') a story that he believes will satisfy him and allow Kint to go free. Not that he is overly worried because he has immunity, which also confuses Kujan.So if you look at the story in real time, most of it takes place in a police station office where Kujan is asking Kint questions. Most of what we see as other action is a depiction of the story Kint is telling Kujan. But Kint talks about certain things (barbershop quartet in Skokie) and people (Kobayashi) that near the end we learn are things he noticed in the office. So it is reasonable to assume much, perhaps almost all, of the story Kint is telling, and we are seeing, is fabricated. Such that, when the movie ends our natural question is \"How much of this was really true?\" That might upset some viewers, but it really speaks to the core of the story. It isn't about what might really have happened at the wharf that fateful night, it is about Verbal Kint and his ability to manipulate the situation in the police station office. Plus whatever he might be in his real life. But he does tell an interesting story, doesn't he?The cast is excellent, Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus, Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, a mumbling Benicio Del Toro as Fred Fenster, Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney and of course Kevin Spacey as Roger 'Verbal' Kint. Also Chazz Palminteri is excellent as Dave Kujan, US Customs.An interesting role is played by Pete Postlethwaite. In the story told by Kint we see him playing Kobayashi. So that might lead one to believe that character was real, not fictional. I look at it differently, Kint has to describe the characters, his description (to Kujan) is what we see as Postlethwaite, who we later find out is in fact tied in with Kint, so it would be dangerous if he really is Kobayashi. Good movie, see it twice, then see it once again. And figure it all out in a way that makes sense to YOU.MAJOR SPOILER: As the interview ends, and Kint reclaims his items, notably \"gold\" watch and \"gold\" lighter, signs of wealth, and leaves, a fax of an image of Keyser Söze is being received at the police station. We see the sketch looks like Verbal Kint, Kujan realizes who he has been interviewing. At the same time we see Kint gradually losing his limp, he had been faking being cripple, he gets into a black car driven by Postlethwaite, the myth and mystery of Keyser Söze continues."},{"username":"blanche-2","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0342623","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1910278","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"14 July 2008","rate":"10","helpful":"5 out of 8 found this helpful.","title":"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled...","content":"1995's beautifully structured \"The Usual Suspects\" is really a very simple story. One of only two survivors of a ship explosion (Kevin Spacey) tells a story to the police detective (Chazz Palminteri) in charge of the case about how five career criminals - the \"usual suspects\" - met in a lineup and wound up working for the man whose very name strikes terror into the hearts of men - Keyser Soze.As a result, two names were on everybody's lips for some months to come: Kevin Spacey and Keyser Soze.With a crackerjack script by Christopher Quarrie, great direction by Bryan Singer and terrific performances, The Usual Suspects couldn't miss. And it doesn't. Thirteen years later, I remember it as vividly as the day I saw it. I just saw it again, and it's as good as ever.Its other stars are the handsome Gabriel Byrne as Keaton, a bad cop who at one point faked his death to avoid criminal charges; and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio del Toro, still a distance from stardom, Kevin Pollak, and Giancarlo Esposito as Kobayashi, Keyser Soze's persuasive assistant.As a scared, not very bright gimpy man, Kevin Spacey is a knockout and well-deserving of his Oscar, his Golden Globe, his SAG Award, his New York Film Critics Award and all his other honors. The writer, Christopher McQuarrie, justly won the Oscar and several other awards. The film and director Singer probably deserved more awards than they received, but it doesn't matter. The Usual Suspects is a modern classic.The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist...and then he's gone."},{"username":"dbdumonteil","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1219578","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1236041","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"12 December 2005","rate":"10","helpful":"291 out of 367 found this helpful.","title":"the American thriller of the nineties","content":"One day in a bookshop, I flipped through a book entitled: \"the movies of the nineties\" and this movie wasn't included! How can a book specialized in cinema skip such a milestone of the last decade? Any movie buff, any cinema critic must have considered the nineties a fruitful era for the American thriller. According to one's tastes, some will say that the best thriller of the nineties is \"Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). For others it will be \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) while others will praise to the skies \"Se7en\" (1995). For me, the pinnacle is this present movie, \"the Usual Suspects\" (1995) with its staggering story (to put it mildly). It's a sensational debut for Bryan Singer which enabled to put him on the map. With a little help from his accomplice Christopher McQuarrie, he signed an unparalleled gem in the landscape of the American thriller, even the whole cinema.The average viewer who watches \"the Usual Suspects\" for the first time might think that the whole crew concocted him a meandering story with as a leading thread, Spacey's convoluted story. At the end of the projection, he may feel puzzled and will probably wish to watch the movie a second time. He won't regret it and Singer and McQuarrie will rejoice at it. Their masterwork gains by several repeated viewings to appreciate the subtleties of a rich movie with a convoluted construction which will take its seemingly definitive form in the five last minutes. To watch \"the Usual Suspects\" is like gathering the pieces of an intriguing puzzle, a little like any other suspenseful movie but in the case of Singer's flick, one will never really be able to completely end it. So many things happen in less than two hours that we are never really sure of what we watch and this is reinforced by a breathtaking unexpected twist at the end which makes our assumptions falter. Singer and McQuarrie take a mischievous delight in taking the viewer in their nebulous scenario and to follow it according to Spacey's declarations and it's obvious that they raise more questions than answers. It's up to the viewer to make his imagination work and to bring his thoughts on the film. This is what inspires its pernicious charm.From Spacey's story, the authors developed a top quality script, set with clockwork precision. Singer's directorial style virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and conveys an increasing tension. It is filled with ingenious visual ideas and served by fluid camera movements. Singer was in his early thirties when he shot his film but it presents the signs of a seasoned author. There's also a tight editing and a unsettling score which cement the movie in its place of winner. More remarkable, the authors pull off with gusto to increase the audience's curiosity throughout the film in spite of a somewhat deliberate confusion and the interest won't weaken until the end which constitute the apex: an unexpected twist which will leave the audience speechless once they understood it. In Singer's flick, it doesn't disappoint because there are little but noticeable visual and verbal clues which justify it. However, it has something unsettling. We believe that we are at the end of the maze but there's more to the picture than meets the eye. Maybe this \"coup de theatre\" veils one more truth. Maybe also the shrewdest ones will have guessed it but the result is the same for any viewer: Singer puts a baffled spectator in his pocket.Singer and Quarrie show a perfect master in the domain of the film noir: an ominous atmosphere, nocturnal scenes which stay rooted in the mind and a deep psychology of certain characters which give more substance to the film. Considering the last point, the character of Gabriel Byrne is the most interesting one: a former crooked cop who seemingly redeemed himself in catering but caught up by his past and forced to come back to work. I personally think that Byrne is the stand-out of the topflight cast the movie boasts. But don't neglect the other members. Kevin Spacey pocketed a deservedly Oscar in 1996 and the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench. Maybe Singer grants a little shallow attention to the three others baddies in the gang but in a way it's necessary to underscore the fact that they're lousy gangsters embroiled in a infernal spiral and unable to perceive what lies beneath all this. Pete Postlewhaite and Chazz Palminteri make their scenes count too.A riveting storytelling, a painstaking flash-back, a tight and first-class directing, a thoughtful twist, a topnotch cast, \"the Usual Suspects\" includes almost everything a director would sell his soul for. Everything contributes to make it a stalwart model in the suspenseful movie and the whole cinema.

It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.Held in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor - leaving few survivors.It sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn't long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.The core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him.We are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite's Kobayashi character, one of Soze's harbinger's of doom, further ups the ante of the story's deliciously corkscrew intrigue.It all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here's the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.The advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic's own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There's a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10"},{"username":"Theo Robertson","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0374604","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"25 September 2003","rate":"7","helpful":"4 out of 18 found this helpful.","title":"Not Sure If I Understood It","content":"!!!!

I actually thought this might have been the ending after all but still clung to my own interpretation . It`s a very ambiguous ending and I don`t believe for a moment that Christopher McQuarrie meant the ending to be so open to interpretation which means it`s not as clever as is made out .
