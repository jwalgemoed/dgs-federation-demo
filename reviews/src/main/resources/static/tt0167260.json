People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy, some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"},{"username":"Leofwine_draca","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0482513","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3528195","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"19 August 2016","rate":"10","helpful":"26 out of 29 found this helpful.","title":"Perfect way to finish the trilogy","content":"Finally, the last movie in the series. Finally, Peter Jackson makes his intentions clear. Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part."},{"username":"SnoopyStyle","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2898520","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3552697","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"29 September 2016","rate":"8","helpful":"7 out of 15 found this helpful.","title":"awards winning epic","content":"Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven.

I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of."},{"username":"Horst_In_Translation","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3914439","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3134092","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"1 December 2014","rate":"6","helpful":"7 out of 82 found this helpful.","title":"The solid ending to a good trilogy","content":"\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\", which sounds like a Robin Hood reference, is the final chapter to Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\"-series. It stars most of the cast from the two previous films and also the crew does not look that much different. What does look different is the awards output. While the first was really successful with the Academy and the second moderately, this one won 11 Oscars, all categories where it was nominated, but missed out on one category to be the alone record holder. This was maybe the cinematography category, where it wasn't even nominated surprisingly. Still, the Best Picture win and Director for Jackson should make up for it.The film features lots of Gollum again too. Actually, it starts with Smeagol back when he was a human. Not much later, we see the killing of Saruman, something we may have expected to be one of the final moments, but this happens so that we see Sauron as the true antagonist of this film and the whole franchise. I found it a bit surprising as Saruman was definitely the main villain in the first two films, the first more than the second. Another thing I liked was the water reflection scene with Gollum/Smeagol. Nicely done here how his good side talks to his evil side. The film's central point is Minas Tirith, but I wasn't too thrilled by that. Scenes like Pippin's possible death with that fireball that he could not put away were more interesting and spectacular than the fight sequences. The part about Boromir's father and the fight for paternal love maybe helped the movie with its award ambitions as the topic is still relevant today, even if in a different manner.Other than that, the arguing between Sam and Gollum continues from the second movie. I just wonder why Sam would lay down so close to the abyss with Gollum around. Anyway, the scene where Frodo sends Sam away is one of the emotional highlights from the trilogy. Pretty sad. In addition to that, Frodo (before he meets the spider) screams Smeagol a couple times, then whispers Sam and realizes who his real friend is. The spider scene is really one of the most intense from all three movies. What a disgusting creature and a perfect moment to pick as it proves Gollum has been evil all the time and even a main antagonist to the two courageous Hobbits at the end. Later on, Sam appears to free Frodo from the Orc headquarter and I wondered a bit why Sam showed the ring to Frodo first. I'd have thought just get out of there guys and not stay there a second longer than you have to.In addition, a couple fathers are dying, good ones and bad ones, and the storyline with Miranda Otto's character is continued. I never found that particularly interesting though and the final chapter doesn't change that. I actually could have done without it in its entirety. Then also the film would not have dragged on some occasions.Finally we get a firework of lava as closure and a sequence which seemed more like a dream (where I thought something bad was about to happen), but it was real, including a final beautiful moment between Sam and Frodo. Astin was the MVP from the final film for me, maybe even the trilogy. If McKellen got an Oscar nomination for the Fellowship, Astin at least would have deserved one too here. Sadly he did not get any, but it was refreshing to see how he stole the films from all these established Hollywood actors being almost a no-name when the trilogy started.It would also have been a nice ending if the film had ended when they all bowed down to the four Hobbits, but it went on for a bit afterward. We find out that the journey started 13 months ago and what happened to Bilbo in the meantime, pretty sad actually. The ending looked almost as if there would be a Sam sequel, but actually we got a Bilbo prequel in these last three years. Annie Lennox' song with the closing credits also won an Oscar for the Eurythmics singer (Enya was nominated two movies earlier) and while I thought it was okay, I believe she has done some better work in her career.All in all, I recommend watching this film/trilogy. I would not call it epic as many do, but it can provide for some nice entertainment and over eleven fantastic hours of film if you are into fantasy movies."},{"username":"claudio_carvalho","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2488512","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0584398","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"29 May 2004","rate":"10","helpful":"17 out of 29 found this helpful.","title":"The Conclusion of an Adventure in the Same Level of the Other Two Parts of a Splendid Story","content":"The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story.

Stunning. Simply stunning.","content":"Frodo and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring, led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orcs.If you check my other reviews you will note that I wasn't a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them, but was not blind to their faults. However, let me just lay my cards out here, I was totally blown away by this film. For the vast majority (and more of that later) the narrative flowed really well where the other two films had struggled to really keep consistent. Here the various strands work well together and, while characters have only brief times to tell stories, on the whole it manages it well. I got the feeling that the film really let rip - it knew this was the ending and it did feel that everything came together in a collection of noise and energy which really made it feel like the final part of a trilogy rather than just a stand alone film.The one area where the film really stutters (and actually caused people to leave the cinema in annoying numbers) is ironically the place where Jackson is true to the book, and that's the final 20 minutes. There is a clear scene where the film ends, however it then runs for another 20 minutes - which is a mix of scenes that all fade out like they were the end. To Joe Public (ie me!) I would have been happy not to have all the loose ends tied up in the way the book does it - the film should have ended on a high (with the King being crowned etc) but instead it seems to crawl to an end in a way that is not in line with the momentum of the film (if not the whole trilogy!) This problem is minor on the grand scheme of things, but I would rather have left the cinema on my high than be made to wonder `when's this ending? Is this the end now? Oh, maybe this is it now?' - but I do understand why it was done this way.The cast, as they have been all the way, are excellent. Wood's Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch (`that still counts as one' being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension). Mortensen is the title character and serves it well, with McKellen also continuing his strong role. I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things. Firstly, both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic, fearsome, hateful and funny. Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character (as opposed the look) is foolish. He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way. It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.The special effects do not stand out - and that's a compliment. Even in state of the art movies of late I have been aware that I could be watching a video game. Here I only occasionally noticed that things were clear computer effects, even though the majority of the film was! This is how they SHOULD be used - not as a draw in their own right but as part of the film. Whether it be the massive battle scenes that are spectacular or the animated spider or just the fact that I forget that Gollum is only an effect, I cannot fault it's use of effects or the sheer visual feast that is this film.I have tried not to gush because there will be plenty of others to do that without me joining them, but it is hard to really fault this film. It is the strongest of the trilogy and brings it all together really well, it is an emotional event more than a film and, if Jackson needs 20 minutes of slow closure to finish it to his satisfaction then I can give him that in return for all the hours of wonderful cinema that he has given me."},{"username":"kosmasp","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5876717","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2099406","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"21 July 2009","rate":"8","helpful":"4 out of 10 found this helpful.","title":"The End is near ...","content":"Like with the first two LotR movies, I hadn't (and still haven't I have to admit) read the books. So if your're looking for any comparison between the book and the movie, you have to look for other comments (and there are plenty of them here). The only thing I know, is that a small part of the end of book two (Two Towers) is implemented in Return of the King. Unfortunately for me, a review I read about the movie, did spoil that fact for me.In case you aren't aware of the book, I won't spoil anything that happens in this movie. But I'm going to assume that you have watched the previous installments (\"Two Towers\" and \"Fellowship\"). Our group has split up in 3 different smaller groups, each of which has it's own journey to go through. While Frodo and Sam have found themselves a companion in Gollum, the end of part two has hinted something dark that might happen here.That's one of the best things of the movies: The interaction and sometimes even seamless transitions between characters feelings for each other (Legolas vs. Gimli to name but one). Most of the time it's done in a subtle manner and even if it's played theatrically (here in this movie, a relationship between a father and his sons), it's impossible to defy the magic this movie brings onto your screen.The action is great (although a villain we can hang ourselves onto, like the leader of the Uruk-Hai in the first movie, is still missing) and the landscape phenomenal as in every movie of the series. While it was clear, that the actors wouldn't be considered Oscar material, they all bring their A-game and especially Viggo Mortensen is a revelation (makes you still wonder, what would've happened if the original actor that was cast for that role, went through with it).The main problem I see here (and many others have stated that also), lies at the end ... well \"endings\". The movie doesn't seem to know, when to stop. So while you think all is over, you get another set-piece ... and another one ... and another one. While this might seem like nit-picking to some, some others were bothered very much by that fact. Still this is the best Fantasy Franchise that has hit our screens and makes other efforts seem pretty dull (Dungeons & Dragons anyone?). Now let's see if I can manage to read \"The Hobbit\" before they make a movie out of it ...

The film opens interestingly with Gollum's origin story, capturing his descent into depravity and madness, finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect it's bearer, and not for good.With the battle of Helm's Deep over and Saruman's power gone, the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy, while those visible are more of a threat than ever. \"The Return of the King\" in it's way is as much Aragorn's story as it is Frodo's; a reluctant noble struggling to find his destiny who comes to accept and eventually embrace it under the tutelage of the White Wizard Gandalf. The subtle subtext of Aragorn's relationship with Lady Arwen of the Elven realm leads to his triumph with no illusions for Eowyn, establishing a noble grace and dignity for the new King.Upon my second viewing of the entire trilogy, I was surprised at how my attention was continually drawn to the character of Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's faithful companion. This in large part to the excellent portrayal by Sean Astin, showing a range of emotions throughout the film that proffered him as the most well developed character of the story. He's a loyal friend through thick and thin, understanding clearly that by the journey's near end, Frodo's mind may no longer be his own.Gimli is another character to keep a close eye on for the understated humor John Rhys-Davies brings to the story. The personal competition he began with Legolas (Orlando Bloom) in \"The Two Towers\" finds comic resonance here; as Legolas brings down a rampaging olyphant on the Pelennor Fields, Gimli tempers his congratulations with \"That still only counts as one\" - marvelous! With the One Ring destroyed, so is Sauron's awesome power, and a quest resolved for the fortunes of mankind. The film's multiple endings encapsulate just as many feelings in the viewer, those of loyalty, honor, love, sacrifice and friendship. As a unit, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy stand as probably the ultimate in cinematic adventure to this point in time. Truly, I can only make one suggestion to make the series even more poignant, that for a film that reveals the discovery of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins, the basis for the adventure that begins in \"The Hobbit\"."},{"username":"lee_eisenberg","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4888011","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1198302","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"21 October 2005","rate":"10","helpful":"13 out of 19 found this helpful.","title":"3rd time's the charm (don't get me wrong; the first two were equally good).","content":"It all comes down to this.

They were outstanding films and deserving of all the awards they received. Perhaps that is one reason I was so disappointed in this movie; it wasn't nearly as interesting as the first two. The main reason can be summed up in one word: OVERKILL.Director Peter Jackson made the same mistake he made in the film he did right after this one: \"King Kong,\" where the action was way too much, too the point of ludicrousness and an insult to viewers' intelligence. So was this film, the third in the LOTR series. It was too much action, so much that after halfway through this 3 hour, 20-minute movie I was numb by then and could care less what happened from that point. I stuck with it, but it just got worse and worse with more ridiculous action scenes going on one after the other with absolutely no credibility to any of them.Examples of what I mean regarding \"credibility\" are scenes in which humongous monsters and machines 100 times the size and strength of the \"good guys\" would always lose. Even females and little Hobbitts disposed of these-supposedly indestructible creatures, time after time. It was so Rambo-like, so stupidly juvenile it was insulting to watch.After awhile, it wasn't even entertaining....the worst sin of them all for fantasy-adventure movie. To use another descriptive word, this film - like Jackson's subsequent King Kong - was EXCESSIVE.By overdoing the action, the awesome-looking creatures and the wonderful special-effects that captured the LOTR audiences for the first two movies, ended this trilogy on a sour note. Too much violence translates into \"boring.\"I also got tired of seeing a 99-percent dead \"Frodo\" somehow still managing to go on and on with these never-ending agonizing looks on his face and his little tearful buddies crying their eyes out constantly. Enough already! Finish the story!This was overkill of the worst magnitude and an almost needless last three hours of a great story."},{"username":"Tweekums","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13977076","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2098382","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"19 July 2009","rate":"10","helpful":"27 out of 33 found this helpful.","title":"A fantastic conclusion to a great trilogy","content":"After a brief prologue showing us how Sméagol came to get the ring and how he came to be the pitiful creature we know the film proper starts where The Two Towers left off; Sméagol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelob's lair and Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard.When Pippin looks into the palantír, a sort of dark crystal ball, he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack, unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle.I thought that the battle of Helm's Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith, here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Sauron's reign once and for all.This is probably the best film of the trilogy, I can see why it raked in the awards, the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though I'm aware that this was in the book.

Later on , Aragorn , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead .This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama and being pretty entertaining . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and spectacular as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values . The film provides enough amusement during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous parts and those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary work . Magnificent direction by Peter Jackson bringing stunningly the imaginary world and mythology of Tolkien to life ."},{"username":"paul_haakonsen","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5449882","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"31 January 2020","rate":"8","helpful":"3 out of 4 found this helpful.","title":"Phenomenal...","content":"The 2003 conclusion to the \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy is a tour de force. This is by all accounts the best movie in the entire trilogy.Why? Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" is a solid eight out of ten stars."},{"username":"BA_Harrison","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0945066","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2333179","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"2 November 2010","rate":"8","helpful":"4 out of 4 found this helpful.","title":"Superelf to the rescue...","content":"I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot.

Pretty to watch, a bit boring to endure.","content":"DVD, widescreen version, surround sound, big screen HDTV. So, it was almost like being in the theater. This final of the trilogy of LOTR movies is fitting but, like the others, a bit too ambitious in trying to cram in most of the contents of the books to please all the 'ringheads'. As a result, the story drags a bit in many places. And, when the climax comes, it is all a bit too cartoonish for my tastes. As in the other installments, the picture and sound are first-rate, some may call them 'reference quality.' The acting and directing are good, but perhaps they try to take this fairy tale a bit too seriously. It would be akin to taking Tom and Jerry cartoons seriously. Still, I am glad that I have the whole set of DVDs, I plan to re-watch certain scenes from time to time, but probably not the whole movie.I will give them to my great grandchildren, and they will wonder, \"What's a DVD?\"SPOILERS follow, for my recollection. As in the first movie, here I got bored with the huge, drawn-out battle scenes. What may work fine in our minds as we read a detailed book is presented in far too much length and detail in the movie. Second, there seems to be a bit too much reliance on viewers knowing something about the 'books.' For example, at the end (SPOILERS!!) when Frodo has to leave The Shire, we are not sure why, and that is such an important piece of the story. From what I now understand, his having been a bearer of the 'One Ring' placed him in a special category, eligible for a place across the waters which is a sort of 'heaven' where he can get R&R from his crusade to return the ring. Something he just could not get in The Shire. MORE SPOILERS: Another thing about the 'cartoon' aspect of the story. As we all know, when Frodo is at the mountain of fire, in such close proximity to the heat and sulfur fumes, he may have lasted 2 or 3 seconds at the most. We know from everything prior that he is normally mortal, a giant spider stings him, he gets cuts and abrasions to his face and torso, in essence having normal vulnerabilities. So, by rights he should also have burned up in the close proximity to the volcano, but doesn't even seem particularly hot. Which signals that the whole series of movies are cartoonish in basis, not to be taken too seriously."},{"username":"Quinoa1984","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0453068","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0583330","warningSpoilers":false,"date":"18 December 2003","rate":"9","helpful":"19 out of 30 found this helpful.","title":"Minor flaws aside, LOTR proves itself one of the most successful trilogies in modern film","content":"In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end. The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment. Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron. There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole. Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up. In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it. It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.

It seems oddly paced, lacking a rhythm, and more importantly lacking the patina of magic that colored the first two. In fact, everything seems brighter this time out.Unlike the battle of the second, they have decided to not have any movie jokes, like the surfer/warrior who winks at the camera. But there is still a variety in tone from place to place as if different directors were involved. I suppose that's true.I remarked on the earlier films that they innovated primarily in how they use the vertical dimension. This third film is even more competent and extreme in that regard. They knew it was a discriminator and exploited it. Unfortunately, the towers and cities and mountain gates all have an unnatural sameness to them, they are photographed with huge vertical sweeps. Even the first ending where everyone bows to the hobbits and there is the obligatory `helicopter' shot, it goes shockingly far beyond what one expects. The way it pulls back fast and swoops reminds that we are used to an eye that is constrained by the aerodynamics of light helicopters.Not so here. When this is considered in hindsight, I'm pretty sure that the high production values won't be noticed; that all the effects and conventions here \u0096 especially the battle scenes \u0096 will be seen as borrowed, all except for the exhilarating use of height. That's worth watching. Magic of its own.That magic is enough to carry this project for me. It is clearly Jackson's intent to move his camera in great vertical arcs, usually in ways that no physical camera could. That gives us a fantastic eye. Just a few hours later, I saw `The Lion King' again and noticed that although they were never constrained by physics, they always moved the `camera' in ways we have seen in ordinary `real' films. That's because `Lion' wanted to look real while `Return' wanted to seem ultrareal.Ian McKellen has always puzzled me, he's sort of a working man's John Gielgud, an engineer of the spoken word. Here, he stoops to Alec Guiness' role. A sad way to cap a career.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3 \u0096 Worth watching"},{"username":"Theo Robertson","userUrl":"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1532177","reviewLink":"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0584171","warningSpoilers":true,"date":"13 February 2004","rate":"10","helpful":"55 out of 77 found this helpful.","title":"A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema`s Greatest Fantasy Epic","content":"It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!I do conclude there are some people in the world who can`t see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It`s simply explained , these epic movies aren`t a childish fantasy , they`re like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it`s not a family film never mind a \" childish fantasy \" . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn`t computer generated he`s a living being and Peter Jackson doesn`t use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it`s like they`re appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble`s character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn`t sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we`re shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music. Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which... It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it`s somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn`t ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it`s not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we`ll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves I`m puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore`s score is beautiful and haunting but it`s far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it`s shameful Andy Serkis wasn`t nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I`ve no idea how John Lesnie`s camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we`ll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn`t stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson .
