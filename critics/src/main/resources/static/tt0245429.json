            "summary_short": "The towering, lost dreaminess at the heart of this magnificent animated film is remarkable. Rather than &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; the movie could better be considered the director Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Through the Looking Glass.&quot; His specialty is taking a primal wish of kids, transporting them to a fantasyland and then marooning them there. The picture's theme is dislocation. That's what happens to little Chihiro (Daveigh Chase), who's trapped in a dream world not of her making. No one else conjures the phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams — that fascinating and frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil — in the way this master Japanese animator does. His movies are as much about moodiness as mood, and the prospect of animated figures not being what they seem — either spiritually or physically — heightens the tension. — Elvis Mitchell",
